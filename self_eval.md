# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? Like always I tend to struggle with the last part of the assignment when it come to combining what I learn, very frustrating.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? Note taking is hard while in session since I can't write and lesson at the same time and lesson go by really fast. All the examples in the lessons really help because I seem to be more of a visual and kinesthetic learner.  I find myself taking the best note when I have time to got over lessons again.  
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? I tend to try and solve the problem by myself first and sometime take too much time before trying Google.  I need to get better at that for sure.
